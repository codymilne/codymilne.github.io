	<h1> Cody's Fresh PC</h1>
    	<p> 
	Now, this is a story all about how, <p>
	My laptop got flipped-turned upside down. <p>
	And, I'd like to take a minute and jot this down here, <p>
	and tell all about how I built my new PC with care. <p>
	In Frys electronics born and raised, <p>
	Watching Linus Tech Tips was where I spent most of my days.<p>
	Liquid cooling, overclocking, thermal paste, all cool, <p>
	And all to get better FPS when I got home from school. <p>
	When a couple of games who were memory hoards, <p>
	Started making trouble on my motherboard. <p>
	I got one little bluscreen and but it had me scared, <p>
	I said, its time to upgrade all components, Devil may care. <p>
	I Saved and penny pinched day after day, <p> 
	But GPU's could not be bought anyway. <p>
	I tried the Newegg lottery daily for a winning ticket, <p> 
	and won a spot for <a href= https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N308TGAMING-OC-12GD#kf> RTX 3080</a> and said, I will get it. <p>
	Then on to ram looking for something fast, <p>
	5200 hertz, DDR5 is part of the master class. <p> 	
	But wait, now my PSU cant power all that, <p>
	Quick Amazon, I will need 1200 watts, Stat. <p>
	All my parts arrived quick on Next day air, <p>
	Hope my old monitor can handle this <strong>PC built with care</strong>.
